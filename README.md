This is a pattern unlock screen, similar to the one on Android.  

Based on vamshi4001's code (https://github.com/vamshi4001/Android-Unlock-4-Web) which has most of the code in place to get the lock screen working, I've made a couple changes here so that it behaves much more like the lock screen.

The pegs on the screen represent numbers, like those on a phone.  ex:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

The current password is '123'.  The password can be found on line 257 of patternlock.js.
