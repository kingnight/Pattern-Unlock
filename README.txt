I've gotten rid of the game functionality and have reorganized the original author's code into a functional lock screen for a web app.



vamshi4001's original readme:

=====================================================================================================================
Functionality
=====================================================================================================================
	1. Please open the index.html to see the pattern grid on the web page.
	2. You need to draw a pattern and click/tap on "Set Pattern" to set it as your pattern.
	3. Now you have the "Unlock Pattern" button activated - In order to unlock it, you need to draw the same pattern as before.
	4. On successful match of pattern, it opens up a success page.
	5. To start again, reload the page.

=====================================================================================================================
Code
=====================================================================================================================
	1. Most of the code has been modularized, so that it's easy to plugin the unlock code in any webpage.
	2. It is optimized as a responsive page, which can be rendered on any mobile device according to it's dimensions.
	3. Touch and click are automatically recognized by the code and no external configurations are required.
	4. The same has been uploaded on my server at http://mycollect.in/unlockpattern/ to view on your mobile devices.
	5. In case of any questions, drop me a mail on vamshi4001@gmail.com. Visit my profile http://vamshi.mycollect.in
